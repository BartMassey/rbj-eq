Thanks to Robert Bristow-Johnson for sharing not only these
filters but a bunch of knowledge about how to implement
them. Thanks to YouTuber Dan Worrall for introducing me to
the RBJ filters, as well as for some amazing audio DSP
content. Thanks to the authors of the `num-traits` and
`numeric_literals` crates for making support for `f32`
easy. Finally, thanks to the `cargo-readme` crate for
generation of this `README`.
